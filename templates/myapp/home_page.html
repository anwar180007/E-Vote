        <p class="lead text-justify">Electronic voting (also known as e-voting) is voting that uses electronic means to either aid or take care of casting and counting ballots.

            Depending on the particular implementation, e-voting may use standalone electronic voting machines (also called EVM) or computers connected to the Internet. It may encompass a range of Internet services, from basic transmission of tabulated results to full-function online voting through common connectable household devices. The degree of automation may be limited to marking a paper ballot, or may be a comprehensive system of vote input, vote recording, data encryption and transmission to servers, and consolidation and tabulation of election results.</p>

        <p>People waiting every year for election and people enjoy it very much.</p>
